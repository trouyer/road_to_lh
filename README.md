# Roads to LH

Roads to LH is a project of [les artisans cartographes](https://les-artisans-cartographes.fr/en-2017-tous-les-chemins-menent-au-havre/) for the 500th anniversary of Le Havre city. The goal is to show that all roads lead to Le Havre (original idea from [roads to Rome](https://roadstorome.moovellab.com/)).

Here are my first scripts in Ruby using [Grahhopper API](https://www.graphhopper.com) which get GPX tracks from metropolitain french cities to LH.

With these GPX tracks Maxime has created a map you can see [here](http://les-artisans-cartographes.fr/en-2017-tous-les-chemins-menent-au-havre/)
