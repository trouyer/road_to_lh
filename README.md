# Roads to LH

Roads to LH is a project of [les artisans cartographes](http://les-artisans-cartographes.fr/) for the 500 aniversary of Le Havre city. Itis aim is to demonstrate that all raods lead to Le Havre.

Here are my first script in Ruby using [Grahhopper API](https://www.graphhopper.com) which get GPX tracks from metropolitain french cities to LH.

With these GPX tracks Maxime has created a map you can see [here](http://les-artisans-cartographes.fr/en-2017-tous-les-chemins-menent-au-havre/)
